# can-of-books-back-end

**Authors**: Ryan McMillan, Dwight Lindquist, and Michael Maker!
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview

Our collective human organization lin-mc-mak shall create a small app to track what books have impacted us, and what’s recommended to read next

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

1. `npm i` on terminal within project repo

2. Encode .env file based on sample.env

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

### Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths.

* Michael: Good at communications

* Ryan: Git skill

* Dwight: Skilled web searcher

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

* We will utilize strengths by dividing up work according to our strengths

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

* Michael: Data parsing

* Ryan: Work-flow

* Dwight: Git skill

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

* If we have questions for each other we will answer thoroughly and encourage equal input.

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

* Talk about it and re-distribute the work so we all learn with happiness emotion in 'human mind'

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

* Talk about it and re-distribute the work so we all learn with happiness emotion in 'human mind'

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Help and encourage each other if there's a lack of understanding so all members understand.
